24/11/21: Discovering the data set, going through quick geographical analysis. Most of the films comes from USA. It may be interesting to do an analysis without USA movies. Look at https://www.the-numbers.com/ to compare the numbers of movies that come from USA from our data set and from external data sets.
25/11/21: Adding data from https://www.the-numbers.com/. Realization of maps for the original data set and the external data set. Comparison between the two.
