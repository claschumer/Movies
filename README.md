## Tasks

### Clarisse
Week 23 novembre: Study on the popularity of movies within different companies, level of budget,genre and categorie. I will use cluster analysis, and distribution function analysis. Divide the data in several groups according to the factors cited above. 
26/11/21: Analysis on the profit and the gross by each genre 
27/11/21: 1) Analysis on which genre is most prominent in regions, and visualization with pie charts. 
          2) Compute the correlation between score and budget in each categorie
29/11/21: Create indicator for type of genre, type of company, variable for log of gross and log of budget, indictor of movies released in USA, and perform cluster analysis. Find optimal number of clusters, and visualization of each variable in a cluster. 
01/12/21: Finalization of cluster analysis, and define profile of each cluster. Clean the code and review for consistency. 

### Paul
Week 23 novembre: a first search for the link between budget and success into some plots (gross then score) without taking inflation into account. How does this link evolved through time ?
Week 30 novembre: looking at some relevant US inflation historical datas. I corrected the values taking inflation into account. I tried to interpret the results for a global evolution
and did some statistic investigation for the evolution of the score and the net profit. I also did a quick analysis decade per decade. 
Week 7 december : global correction of the report

### Raphaël
24/11/21: Discovering the data set, going through quick geographical analysis. Most of the films comes from USA. It may be interesting to do an analysis without USA movies. Look at https://www.the-numbers.com/ to compare the numbers of movies that come from USA from our data set and from external data sets.
25/11/21: Adding data from https://www.the-numbers.com/. Realization of maps for the original data set and the external data set. Comparison between the two.
29/11/21: Beginning the report on Overleaf. Smoothen the label on the maps. Thinking of another direction to go : -link between movie production in country and money invested. 30/11/21: Table of production of movies per country on R. Add to the report on overleaf.01/12/21: Redaction of the part: ‘Presentation of the data set’ in the report.


### Marie
Week 23 novembre: 1)Discovering the data: documentation context + plot correlation, box plot to observe the data landscape and to find a problematic. Choose problematic: a) What is the best release date (best in the sense of popular, votes) b) Wich actor and director to choose to have a popular movie ? Start to answer b). Week 29 november: Continue to answer b), study the which actor to make a popular or profitable movie + look at the choice of director but finally Ilan will study it. Instead go further in the study of the actor by look at the genre. Then answer a), look at the number of released by months, the average profit by month and the average profit by month and by genre. The difficulty here was to build the good data frame from the based data to plot our figures.
